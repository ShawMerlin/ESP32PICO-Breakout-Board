# ESP32PICO-Breakout-Board

Here I have a simple breakout board for the new ESP32-PICO Chip.
All the parts I have inlucded with JLCPCB Numbers so their assemble service can be used as well.

Breakout boards for this are $30+ on sites so I wanted a cost effective option for testing this chip.
Feel free to take the Kicad files and change them however you see fit.  Enjoy!!

We want to update our ShawLED Controller board with this little chip, very exciting times!!

3D Model of a Quarter was put in the picture to give an idea of how tiny this little guy is.  :)
