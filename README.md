# ESP32PICO-Breakout-Board

Here I have a simple breakout board for the new ESP32-PICO Chip.
All the parts I have included with JLCPCB Numbers so their assembly service can be used as well.

*Still getting some values on a few decoupling capacitors*

Breakout boards for this are $30+ on sites so I wanted a cost effective option for testing this chip.
Feel free to take the Kicad files and change them however you see fit.  Enjoy!!

We want to update our ShawLED Controller board with this little chip, very exciting times!!

3D Model of a Quarter was put in the picture to give an idea of how tiny this little guy is.  :)

I run a Facebook page for all my electronic/modding adventures.  I post things on there before they end up here on Github.
I love the feedback and comments that people share.  It helps us achieve bigger and better things!!
